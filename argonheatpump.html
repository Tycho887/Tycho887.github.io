        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project was part of the FYS155 course at NMBU in autumn 2023. It aimed to investigate the efficiency of heat pumps using different working gases. I designed an experiment to measure the efficiency of an argon heat pump. Argon was selected due to its availability in the lab, and based on theoretical considerations, it should demonstrate slightly higher efficiency compared to air. This is due to argon’s lower specific heat capacity, which theoretically results in about 1-2% higher efficiency compared to air when used in Stirling cycles.</p>

        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <p>The efficiency of a heat pump, especially one following the Stirling cycle, is largely dependent on the properties of the working gas. According to Stirling cycle theory, the efficiency (<i>η</i>) is a function of the heat capacity of the gas and the thermodynamic processes it undergoes. The specific heat capacity of a gas directly impacts the energy required to heat it. Lower heat capacity means less energy is needed, resulting in a higher efficiency. In this experiment, argon was chosen because it has a lower specific heat capacity (20.79 J/mol·K) than air (29.2 J/mol·K). Therefore, it theoretically achieves better performance. The formula used for calculating efficiency was:</p>
        <p><strong>η = RThk / (CvΔT + RTck)</strong></p>
        <p>Where <i>R</i> is the gas constant, <i>Th</i> and <i>Tc</i> are the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, and <i>Cv</i> is the specific heat capacity. This suggests that gases with lower <i>Cv</i> values, like argon, should improve performance in a Stirling cycle.</p>

        <h2>Experiment</h2>
        <p>To empirically determine the difference in efficiency between argon and air as working gases in a heat pump, a controlled experiment was conducted. The experiment employed a beta-type Stirling engine run in reverse as a heat pump. The key measurements were the temperature change over time when heating a fixed volume of water, as well as voltage and current inputs. The heat pump was tested with both air and argon, and the resulting data was statistically analyzed using a two-tailed t-test.</p>
        <p>The experimental setup involved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Leybold heat engine configured as a heat pump.</li>
            <li>A digital thermometer and ammeter for measuring temperature and electrical input.</li>
            <li>A custom-built calorimeter for heating water using the pump's output.</li>
            <li>Pressurized argon gas and standard air as the two working gases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Six trials were conducted for each gas. Each trial involved measuring the time taken to heat 8 mL of water over a specified temperature range. The efficiency was then calculated based on the heat transferred and the electrical work done.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>After conducting the experiment, the results revealed a statistically significant difference between the efficiency of argon and air heat pumps. The average Coefficient of Performance (COP) for argon was lower than for air, contrary to the initial hypothesis based solely on theoretical values. A p-value of 0.0107 was obtained from the t-test, confirming the difference with a 95% confidence level. This finding supports rejecting the null hypothesis, indicating that air may be a more efficient working gas than argon under these experimental conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Observations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Argon showed a consistently lower COP than air.</li>
            <li>The average COP for air was slightly over 10% higher than for argon.</li>
            <li>Potential sources of error include heat losses in the calorimeter, non-ideal gas behavior, and slight variations in gas purity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While theory predicts that argon should yield higher efficiency due to its lower heat capacity, the experimental results suggest otherwise. Air proved to be more efficient under the test conditions. This may be due to experimental limitations such as heat losses or calibration issues. Nevertheless, the results highlight the importance of gas selection in heat pump applications, though further tests with alternative gases (such as CO<sub>2</sub> or helium) might be necessary for a clearer understanding of efficiency variations.</p>
