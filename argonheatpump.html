        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>As a part of the course FYS155 which i took at nmbu autumn 2023, we were asked to design an experiment and present the result. After learning to use the TermoPy library which i was developing at the time, 
            i noticed that the choice of working gas had a noticable effect on the efficency of the heat pump. I decided to investigate this further and designed an experiment to measure the efficency of argon heat pumps, as theoretically it should
        have a difference in efficency of around 1% from that of normal air. The choice of argon was due to availability in the lab</p>

        <p>I will write more here</p>
